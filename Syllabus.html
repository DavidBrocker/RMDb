<hr />
<p><strong>Classroom Etiquette:</strong> In these increasingly strange times, there needs to be a few additions to the standard classroom guidelines.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When arriving to class, you <em>must</em> have a face covering on until you are seated at a safe distance from your classmates. There is no exception to this at all. If you get up to leave the classroom for any reason, you must put back on your face covering. I have a <strong><span style="color:red">zero</span></strong> tolerance policy in regards to this, if I have to ask you <strong>once</strong> you will not be permitted to come back into the classroom.</p></li>
<li><p>When watching the livestream, I will ask students at home questions from time-to-time so I advise that you have a device capable of both audio and video access. I will <strong>never</strong> make you turn on your camera, but I will politely ask. Please keep in mind that if your microphone is on while I am teaching it will make learning a bit difficult!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cancellation of Classes:</strong> Weather and other campus-wide cancellations will be listed on the home page, <a href="www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and you can also sign up for RAVE and SUNY Alert. Go to the <a href="www.farmingdale.edu">Rave</a> web page and use your Farmingdale user ID and password to enter the site. For SUNY-Alert, please visit the University Police web page. If class needs to be canceled when the campus is open, students will be notified via email.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Devices Policy:</strong> Cell phones should be turned off or to airplane mode during class unless you are expecting an emergency call. Laptops may be brought to class to take notes. If laptops become a distraction, the instructor has the authority to change this policy. AirPods or any type of headphones need to be removed when you come to class. The first offense will be a verbal warning, the second offense I will ask you to leave the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong> Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class. Missing classes will negatively impact your ability to grasp the material, but not your grade. Participation <em>is</em> included in your grade and if you are not present in class, it will make it quite difficult to participate!</p>
<p><strong>Religious Absences:</strong> If you are unable to attend class on certain days due to religious beliefs, please consult with your instructor well in advance of the absence so that appropriate accommodation can be made.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Email:</strong> It is College policy that instructors and students use the Farmingdale email system or the Blackboard email system to contact one another.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Statement:</strong> Course material accessed from Blackboard or the Farmingdale website is for the exclusive use of students who are currently enrolled in the course. Content from these systems cannot be reused or distributed without written permission of the instructor and/or the copyright holder. Duplication of materials protected by copyright, without permission of the copyright holder, is a violation of the Federal copyright law, as well as a violation of SUNY copyright policy.</p>
<p><strong>Disability Services Center:</strong> If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Disability Services Center, Roosevelt Hall, Room 151, or call 934- 420-2411, or 420–2607 as soon as possible this semester.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity Policy:</strong> Because intellectual honesty is a cornerstone of all academic and scholarly work, each member of the Farmingdale State College campus community is expected to maintain academic integrity. Farmingdale State College has developed regulations concerning academic dishonesty and integrity to protect all students and to maintain an ethical academic environment. For more information, click the updated link for the Academic Integrity Policy.</p>
<p>It is important for you to understand the concept of plagiarism. Plagiarism is intentionally representing the words, images or ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise. This includes words, images or ideas in either print or electronic format.</p>
<p>Students will automatically receive a grade of zero (0) on an assignment suspected of plagiarism.</p>
<p><strong>Student Code of Conduct:</strong> The President of the College and the Vice President for Student Affairs recognize the rights of designees including University Police, to enforce all regulations, policies, license agreements, laws and codes on campus. If any individual allegedly violates the laws, Student Code of Conduct or campus policies, a President’s designee will institute proceedings against the offender(s). For more information on the student code of conduct, see the Code of Conduct section in the current Student Handbook, or choose Code of Conduct from the A-Z Links.</p>
<p><strong><a href="www.farmingdale.edu">Psychology Department Extra Credit Research Participation:</a></strong> Research experiments are a key component of the science of psychology. As a student in a psychology class, you will get the opportunity to participate in some of these experiments through the Research Participant Pool. Students who complete all of the requirements of participation for an experiment will receive up to 10 extra points on one psychology exam. You will receive additional information about this opportunity in class. Be sure to sign up right away if you want to participate! This is first come, first serve!</p>
<p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> There will be extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. I do not curve or round any grades.</p>
<p><strong>Missing/Late Work:</strong> Any assignments that are missed <strong>due to an absence</strong> can be made up provided that you personally email me. I will not reach out to you for missed work. It is your responsibility to be on top of your academic performance in this class.</p>
<p>Any assignments that are late will be accepted, with a deduction of points.</p>
<p><strong>Disagreements or conflicts:</strong> In the event of a disagreement with any of the policies outlined above, the student is directed to address the issue with the instructor. In the event that the conflict cannot be resolved, it should be taken to the Psychology Department Chairperson, Dr. Marya Carter, (934-420-2725) for review.</p>
<p><strong>University Police:</strong> 934-420-2111</p>
